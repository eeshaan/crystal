# Crystal
"Weighted" assignment tracker using a PriorityQueue â€” built with JavaFX.

## Getting Started
- Create new Eclipse project. Call it `crystal`.
  - Go to `Libraries` tab. Add your local `JavaFX11` user library to the class path.
- Create a new package within your project. Call it `application`.
- Create a new class within the new `application` package. Call it `Main`.
  - In the superclass field, type `javafx.application.Application`.
  
- Now clone this git repo somewhere else.
  - `git clone https://github.com/eeshaan/crystal.git`
- Copy the contents from this repo into your Eclipse project.
  - Be sure to include the hidden files from this repo (a folder called `.git` and a file called `.gitignore`) in your copy!
  - Select some form of the "yes" option when your computer prompts you if you want to replace the files.
 - You're all set up. Run a `git status` inside your Eclipse project directory and make sure everything is up-to-date.

Other notes or comments to the grader:

- We received approval from Deb to complete this project instead of MilkWeight.

- In terms of the "ending screen" requirement for file export, our program instead will periodically output a saved_state.json every time the user makes a change. This saved_state.json can be reloaded into the program by using the plus button.
  - If this design choice is still unclear, you can review our Figma GUI layout: https://www.figma.com/file/2QNzRynbQduohnqaPJqacQ/Assignment-Tracker

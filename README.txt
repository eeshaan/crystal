Instructions:
- to run, simply use the runjar command — the json-simple-1.1.1.jar library is built into executable.jar
- you can add an assignment by clicking the '+' button
- you can manage an assignment by clicking on its entry in the left panel — changes are reflected in the data structures and the output JSON
- saved_state.json is created automatically every time the program is closed

Known bugs:

Future work:
- Some enhancements we would like to make include:
  - showing assignments within the DatePicker cells
  - making the app window size change dynamically based on the size of the user's screen
  - implementing the search algorithm, possibly by adding all assignments into an n-ary search tree
- For a full, comprehensive list, see: https://github.com/eeshaan/crystal/issues
